## Current Focus

**Objective**: Implement Milestone 2 - User Experience & Personality (v0.4.0)

### Just Completed (2025-12-01)

1. **Milestone 2 Planning Session** ✅
   - Full blueprint generated: `specs/BLUEPRINT-project-milestone2-ux-personality-20251201.yaml`
   - 6 epics, 15 features, 44 tasks (all complexity ≤3.0 after decomposition)
   - 3 spikes identified and documented
   - Translated to PROGRESS.md + ISSUES.md

2. **Blueprint Highlights**:
   - Epic 2.1: Memory Architecture Refactor (align with Anthropic's approach)
   - Epic 2.2: Chat History (vertical tabs sidebar)
   - Epic 2.3: Projects Feature (isolated context, multi-Xero org)
   - Epic 2.4: Per-Chat Document Upload (+ icon)
   - Epic 2.5: Pip's Voice & Personality (Adelaide / Pippin) **CRITICAL**
   - Epic 2.6: Testing & Documentation

3. **Spikes Required Before Implementation**:
   - spike_m2_001: Cross-Project Reference Research (2 days)
   - spike_m2_002: React.js Refactor Assessment (2 days)
   - spike_m2_003: Character Voice Methodology Research (3 days)

### Recommended Sequence

1. **Epic 2.1** (Memory Refactor) - Foundation for all features
2. **Epic 2.2** (Chat History) - High user value, low risk
3. **Epic 2.3** (Projects) - Complex, needs careful implementation
4. **Epic 2.5** (Voice) - CRITICAL for retention, run spikes early
5. **Epic 2.4** (Document Upload) - Medium priority, spike dependent
6. **Epic 2.6** (Testing) - Continuous throughout milestone

### Language Rules (User-Facing Content)
- ❌ NEVER use "AI" (overused marketing hype)
- ❌ NEVER use "query" (too technical)
- ✅ Focus on what the tool actually does

## Deployment Status

| Service | URL | Health |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Landing Page | https://pip.arcforge.au | 🟢 |
| PWA | https://app.pip.arcforge.au | 🟢 |
| MCP Server | https://mcp.pip.arcforge.au | 🟢 |

**VPS**: DigitalOcean Sydney (170.64.169.203)
**Containers**: pip-app, pip-mcp (memory-enabled)

## Test Results (2025-11-30)

### All Tests Passed ✅

| Platform | Memory Add | Memory Search | Xero Tools |
|----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Claude.ai** | ✅ Working | ✅ 80% relevance | ✅ All 10 tools |
| **ChatGPT** | ✅ Working | ✅ 80% relevance | ✅ All 10 tools |

**Notes**:
- Claude.ai: Direct tool calls (native MCP support)
- ChatGPT: Requires meta-tool pattern (`get_tools_in_category` → `execute_tool`)
- Memory uses text-based search (semantic search disabled for Alpine compatibility)

## Known Issues

| ID | Priority | Summary | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| issue_010 | - | Mem0 SQLite crash in Docker | ✅ Resolved (switched to native) |
| issue_008 | - | Memory architecture decision | ✅ Resolved (Option B deployed) |
| issue_005 | - | ChatGPT memory in Dev Mode | ✅ Resolved (native memory works) |
| issue_004 | - | Safety guardrails | ✅ Complete |

## Design Decisions (2025-11-30)

### Removed: Relationship Progression System

**Decision**: Remove the planned "colleague → partner → friend" progression model.

**Rationale**:
- Vague and overcomplicated for a bookkeeping tool
- Not relevant to core user needs (preferences, key details, business context)
- Anthropic's official MCP Memory Server validates simpler approach (~350 lines, no progression)
- Current text-based memory is sufficient for MVP

**What we kept**: Simple memory that stores preferences, remembers key details, works across chats, and persists between Docker restarts.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Onboard beta users** - Share with trusted users for feedback
2. **Monitor production** - Watch for errors, memory usage
3. **Full planning session** - Interactive Q&A with agent, new blueprint, refresh PROGRESS.md

---

## Feature Backlog (2025-11-30 Night)

*Captured for tomorrow's planning session.*

### 1. Automatic Memory Management
- Memory should "just work" like Anthropic's MCP Memory Server
- Seamless - no explicit management needed by user
- LLM extracts facts automatically, server stores them
- Currently requires explicit `add_memory` calls - should be automatic

### 2. Chat History (like Claude.ai)
- Persistent conversation history across sessions
- Sidebar showing past chats
- Ability to continue previous conversations
- Currently: No chat history in MCP mode

### 3. Projects Feature (Isolated Context)
- Like Claude.ai's Projects
- Separate knowledge bases per project/client
- Isolated memory and context per project
- Use case: Different Xero orgs, different business contexts

### 4. Per-Chat Document Upload
- Plus icon (+) in chat to add documents to THIS conversation
- Replace current global context upload
- More intuitive UX - documents relevant to current chat
- Global preferences/context: defer and test later

### 5. Pip's Voice/Personality
Two character options (switchable in settings):

**Option A: Adelaide Bookkeeper**
- Smart young woman from Adelaide
- Knows the books, keeps it simple
- Professional but approachable
- Target avatar: Sam (our customer persona)

**Option B: Pip from LOTR**
- Fun, endearing character inspired by Pippin
- Somehow great at bookkeeping (unexplained)
- Playful but competent
- More personality-driven

**UX**: Toggle in settings or via chat command

### 6. Deferred Investigations
- Global preferences vs specific options (test both)
- Claude.ai-style custom instructions
- Whether generic or domain-specific settings work better
