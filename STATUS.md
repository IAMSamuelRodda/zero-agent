| **ChatGPT** | 🟡 | Needs verification with memory tools |
| **Memory Stack** | 🟢 | Option B deployed (native, text-based search) |
| **Safety Guardrails** | 🟢 | Complete (tiered permissions) |
| **PWA Frontend** | 🟢 | Live at app.pip.arcforge.au |

## Current Focus

**Objective**: Test memory tools and verify ChatGPT integration.

### Just Completed (2025-11-30 Late Evening)

1. **Memory System Fixed (issue_010)** ✅
   - Option A (mem0) crashed with `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` - mem0ai bug in Docker/Alpine
   - Option B (native) crashed with `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` - onnxruntime needs glibc
   - **Solution**: Removed @xenova/transformers, use text-based search
   - Memory tools now working with better-sqlite3
   - Trade-off: Text search vs semantic search (acceptable for MVP)

2. **Technical Fixes** ✅
   - memory-native.ts creates its own tables on init
   - Embedding code commented out (Alpine/musl incompatible)
   - Fixed getAllMemories bug (was calling wrong method)
   - Server starts cleanly without crashes

3. **Previous Session** ✅
   - Claude.ai OAuth and Xero tools fully working
   - Login page UI fixed (centered, no emoji)
   - Landing page live

### Ready for Testing

- [ ] Memory tools via Claude.ai (`add_memory`, `search_memory`, etc.)
- [ ] Memory tools via ChatGPT Dev Mode

## Deployment Status

| Service | URL | Health |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Landing Page | https://pip.arcforge.au | 🟢 |
| PWA | https://app.pip.arcforge.au | 🟢 |
| MCP Server | https://mcp.pip.arcforge.au | 🟢 |

**VPS**: DigitalOcean Sydney (170.64.169.203)
**Containers**: pip-app, pip-mcp (memory-enabled)
**Ollama**: Running as systemd service with nomic-embed-text

---

## Test Plan

### Memory Tool Tests (Claude.ai) - NEXT

1. **Connect to MCP**: Settings → Connectors → mcp.pip.arcforge.au
2. **OAuth**: `pip-mcp-client` / `pip-mcp-secret-change-in-production`

| Test | Prompt | Expected |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Add memory** | "Use add_memory to remember I prefer invoices on Mondays" | Confirmation |
| **Search memory** | "Use search_memory to find my invoice preferences" | Returns Monday preference |
| **List memories** | "Use list_memories to show everything you know about me" | Shows all memories |
| **Delete memory** | "Use delete_memory to remove [memory_id]" | Confirmation |

### Memory Tool Tests (ChatGPT Dev Mode)

1. **Disconnect and reconnect** the Pip connector
2. **Explicitly request tool usage**: "Use the add_memory tool to..."

| Test | Expected (Option A - mem0) | Expected (Option B - native) |
|------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Tool visibility | May be limited | Full visibility |
| Memory add | May timeout | Should work |
| Memory search | May timeout | Should work |

## Known Issues

| ID | Priority | Summary | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| issue_008 | - | Memory architecture decision | ✅ Resolved (A/B implemented, Option A deployed) |
| issue_005 | P1 | ChatGPT memory in Dev Mode | 🟡 Testing needed |
| issue_004 | - | Safety guardrails | ✅ Complete |
