## Business Direction (2025-11-26)

### Upcoming Validation
- **Demo scheduled**: Thursday 10am (next week) with dental practice owner
- **Purpose**: Validate product-market fit, gather feedback, identify missing features
- **Key questions**: Does it solve the pain? What's missing? What would they pay?

### Target Market Exploration
Primary segments under consideration:
1. **Healthcare Practice Owners** (dentists, physios, GPs) - HIGH priority (direct validation path)
2. **Small Business Owners** (general Xero users) - MEDIUM priority
3. **Web3/Crypto Businesses** - MEDIUM priority (may require wallet integration)
4. **Accountants/Bookkeepers** - LOW priority (B2B, longer sales cycle)

### Distribution Strategy
| Platform | Priority | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| PWA (web) | HIGH | Scaffolded | ✅ `display: standalone` configured - native-like experience |
| Self-hosted (Docker) | HIGH | Pending | Week 2 target |
| Managed service | HIGH | Ready to deploy | $20/month tier |
| iOS App Store | MEDIUM | Future | Required for scale |
| Google Play Store | MEDIUM | Future | Broader Android reach |
| F-Droid | LOW | Future | Privacy-conscious users |

**Note**: PWA with `display: standalone` in manifest provides near-native experience without app store overhead. Evaluate native app investment after 6 months based on adoption data.

## Current Focus

### 🎯 Major Pivot: Open Source Platform (2025-11-17)

**Decision**: Pivoting from proprietary SaaS to open source platform (MIT license)
- See `VISION.md` for philosophy
- See `docs/ADR-012-open-source-platform-architecture.md` for technical architecture

**Key Changes**:
1. ✅ **LLM Agnostic**: Support ANY LLM provider (not just Anthropic)
   - API key support: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Grok
   - OAuth support: Google Gemini (now), OpenAI (coming soon)
   - Local models: Ollama, LM Studio, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

2. ✅ **Database Agnostic**: Support multiple backends
   - SQLite (self-hosted default)
   - PostgreSQL (advanced self-hosting)
   - DynamoDB (managed service)
   - Supabase (future)

3. ✅ **Self-Hostable + Managed**: Hybrid deployment model

## Known Issues

### Critical
None currently.

### High Priority
None currently.

### Architecture Debt (Post-Pivot)
1. **LLM Provider Hardcoded**: Currently tightly coupled to Anthropic
   - Need to implement abstraction layer before deploying
   - Target: Week 1 completion

2. **Database Hardcoded**: Currently assumes DynamoDB
   - Need SQLite adapter for self-hosting
   - Target: Week 1 completion

3. **No Self-Hosting Docs**: Docker Compose not yet created
   - Target: Week 2 completion
