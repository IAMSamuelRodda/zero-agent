## Design Decisions (2025-11-30)

### Removed: Relationship Progression System

**Decision**: Remove the planned "colleague → partner → friend" progression model.

**Rationale**:
- Vague and overcomplicated for a bookkeeping tool
- Not relevant to core user needs (preferences, key details, business context)
- Anthropic's official MCP Memory Server validates simpler approach (~350 lines, no progression)
- Current text-based memory is sufficient for MVP

**What we kept**: Simple memory that stores preferences, remembers key details, works across chats, and persists between Docker restarts.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Milestone 2)

1. **Fix issue_023** - P1: Empty chat delete + memory retrieval edge cases
2. **Verify issue_021** - P2: Test Response Styles in actual chat
3. **issue_034: Skills System** - P1: Report templates & agent capabilities
4. **Deploy & Test** - Visual testing of new ChatInputArea component
5. **Onboard beta users** - Share with trusted users for feedback

### Future Vision (Milestone 3+)

6. **issue_037: Intelligent Expense Separation** - Vision-stage planning complete
   - Target: Users operating from mixed personal/business accounts
   - Core question: "What can I actually spend?"
   - Requires spikes before implementation (see blueprint)
   - See: `VISION.md` "Future Direction" section
