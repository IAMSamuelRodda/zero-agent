# Pip - Project Status

> **Purpose**: Current work, active bugs, and recent changes (2-week rolling window)
> **Lifecycle**: Living (update daily/weekly during active development)

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29
**Current Phase**: MCP Integration Validation
**Version**: 0.2.0
**Infrastructure**: DigitalOcean VPS (shared with do-vps-prod services)

---

## Current Focus

### Phase: MCP Remote Server Integration

**Objective**: Validate Pip works seamlessly inside Claude.ai, then ChatGPT.

**Priority Order**:
1. **Claude.ai Integration** - Validate MCP server works with Claude Pro/Max/Team
2. **ChatGPT App Integration** - Once Claude works, adapt for ChatGPT Apps SDK
3. **Landing Page** - Create pip.arcforge.au to explain both options

**Why this order**: Claude.ai has mature MCP support. ChatGPT Apps SDK is newer and in preview.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate

1. **Validate Claude.ai Integration**
   - Connect MCP server to Claude.ai (Pro account required)
   - Test all 10 Xero tools via Claude
   - Document any issues or required changes

2. **Create User Guide**
   - How to get token URL from /login
   - How to add custom integration in Claude.ai
   - Troubleshooting common issues

### After Claude.ai Validated

3. **ChatGPT Integration**
   - Test with ChatGPT Apps SDK
   - Adapt server if needed
   - Document ChatGPT-specific setup

4. **Landing Page** (pip.arcforge.au)
   - What is Pip? (one-liner)
   - Two options: PWA or Claude.ai/ChatGPT integration
   - Arc Forge branding, dark theme

### Future

5. Voice Mode (Milestone 2)
6. Enhanced personality/memory features
7. Additional accounting platform support

## Business Context

### Target Avatar
**Primary**: Small business owner managing own books
- Owner-operator, 0-5 employees
- $100k-$500k/year revenue
- Using Xero, stressed about BAS/GST
- Core pain: "I didn't start this business to do bookkeeping"

### Distribution Strategy

| Platform | Priority | Status | Cost to Us |
|----------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Claude.ai MCP** | HIGH | 🔵 Validating | $0 LLM |
| **ChatGPT App** | HIGH | ⚪ After Claude | $0 LLM |
| PWA (standalone) | MEDIUM | 🟢 Live | API costs |
| Self-hosted | LOW | 🟢 Ready | $0 |

**Key Insight**: MCP distribution = users bring their own LLM subscription = $0 inference costs for Arc Forge.

### Secured Domains
- askpip.au (secured)
- app.pip.arcforge.au (live - PWA)
