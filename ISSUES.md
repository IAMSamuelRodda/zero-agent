## Open Issues

### Improvements

#### issue_003: Email Verification for Sign-Up
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P3 (Low - deferred)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server` (OAuth sign-up)
- **Description**: Add email verification before account activation
- **Options**:
  - Resend (3000/month free)
  - SendGrid (100/day free)
  - Postmark (100/month free)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] User signs up → receives verification email
  - [ ] User clicks link → account activated
  - [ ] Cannot use Pip until verified
- **Notes**: Deferred - invite codes provide sufficient access control for beta. Implement before public launch.

#### issue_004: Safety Guardrails for Write Operations
- **Status**: 🔵 In Progress (Design complete)
- **Priority**: P1 (HIGH - before any write operations)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server`, `packages/server`, `packages/pwa-app`
- **Spec**: `specs/SAFETY-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Description**: Implement tiered permission model to prevent AI from accidentally destroying Xero data
- **Why Critical**: Xero has NO user-accessible restore. Deleted/voided data is permanently lost.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Database tables: user_settings, operation_snapshots
  - [ ] Permission levels: Read-only (default), Create drafts, Approve/Update, Delete/Void
  - [ ] Pre-operation snapshots before any write
  - [ ] Dynamic tool visibility based on permission level
  - [ ] Settings UI in PWA
- **Notes**: All current tools are read-only (zero risk). This must be implemented BEFORE adding any write operations.

#### issue_005: ChatGPT Memory Disabled in Developer Mode
- **Status**: 🟡 In Progress (Memory Stack planned)
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - affects Plus users)
- **Component**: External (ChatGPT limitation) + `packages/mcp-remote-server`
- **Description**: ChatGPT disables memory when MCP connectors are used in Developer Mode
- **Solution**: Implement Pip Memory Stack (Priority 2 in STATUS.md)
- **ChatGPT Business Option**: Published connectors MAY retain memory (UNVERIFIED)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Research memory approaches (mem0, SQLite, vector DB)
  - [ ] Implement user_memories table
  - [ ] Add memory extraction + injection to MCP
  - [ ] Create memory import endpoint
  - [ ] Add memory management UI to PWA
- **Notes**: Memory stack enables "Pip knows me" for Plus users and cross-platform memory portability.
- **Reference**: docs/CHATGPT-MEMORY-GUIDE.md

#### issue_006: Google Docs Integration
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P3 (Low - future enhancement)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server`
- **Description**: Allow users to connect Google Docs to Pip for business context
- **Use Case**: Users store business plans, KPIs, meeting notes in Google Docs. Connecting these would enrich Pip's context without manual file uploads.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Google OAuth integration
  - [ ] Google Docs API read access
  - [ ] Document sync/indexing
  - [ ] Context injection from connected docs
- **Notes**: Common request - many SMBs use Google Workspace. Consider Google Drive broader integration.

#### issue_007: Nextcloud Integration
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P3 (Low - future enhancement)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server`
- **Description**: Allow users to connect Nextcloud for business context (open source alternative)

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Nextcloud OAuth/API integration
  - [ ] Document sync from Nextcloud Files
  - [ ] Support for Nextcloud Notes
  - [ ] Context injection from connected docs

- **Notes**: Core differentiator vs JAX (Xero AI). Full blueprint at `specs/BLUEPRINT.yaml`

#### issue_001: PWA Connect Button Loading State
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P2
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app`
- **Description**: Connect to Xero button needs better visual feedback during OAuth flow
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Loading spinner during redirect
  - [ ] Disable button while connecting
  - [ ] Clear error state display
- **Notes**: Basic implementation exists, needs polish before demo

#### issue_002: Chat Message Timestamps
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P3
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app`

## Risk Registry

Risks identified during blueprint complexity assessment.

### risk_000: Xero 25-User Limit for Unapproved Apps
- **Severity**: High
- **Probability**: Certain (hard limit)
- **Impact**: Cannot onboard more than 25 users until Xero app approval
- **Constraint**: Xero requires app approval for >25 connected organizations
- **Mitigation**:
  - Track connected Xero orgs in database
  - Enforce limit in code (reject new Xero connections after 25)
  - Apply for Xero app approval before hitting limit
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Add user count check before Xero OAuth
  - [ ] Display "beta full" message when limit reached
  - [ ] Track connected org count in admin dashboard
- **Timeline**: Must implement before public beta launch
- **Reference**: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/app-partnership/

### risk_001: VPS Memory Constraint
- **Severity**: High
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Cannot self-host Chatterbox TTS
- **Mitigation**: spike_003 (Chatterbox Feasibility Spike)
- **Contingency**: Use cloud TTS API (ElevenLabs $0.18/1000 chars)

### risk_002: Demo Incomplete
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Thursday demo fails to show Business Context Layer
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize features 1.1, 1.3, task 1.4.2 (demo critical path)
- **Contingency**: Demo existing Xero features + explain context vision

### risk_003: Voice Latency Too High
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Voice conversations feel sluggish (>2s latency)
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing at each pipeline stage
- **Contingency**: Accept higher latency for MVP; optimize post-launch
