## Open Issues

### Known Issues (Low Priority)

#### issue_050: Tools Dropdown Z-Index Issue
**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P3 (Low - Known issue in Claude.ai too)
**Component:** ChatInputArea - Tools dropdown
**Created:** 2025-12-10

**Description:**
Tools dropdown appears underneath sticky header when opening upward (near bottom of viewport), making top portion unusable. Z-index adjustment from 20 to 50 didn't resolve.

**Impact:**
Minor UX annoyance - users need to scroll up slightly before opening tools menu.

**Workaround:**
Scroll up before opening tools dropdown.

**Notes:**
- Same issue exists in Claude.ai's interface
- Likely requires DOM restructuring or React portal implementation
- Not worth fixing immediately given low impact

### High Priority Issues

### Medium Priority Issues

#### issue_044: Remove Global currentProjectId Dependency
**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - architectural improvement)
**Component:** \`packages/pwa-app/src/store/projectStore.ts\`, \`packages/pwa-app/src/store/chatStore.ts\`
**Created:** 2025-12-10

**Description:** Global \`currentProjectId\` state causes subtle bugs and race conditions. Should be refactored to explicit parameter passing.

**Current Problems:**
- Multiple places set \`currentProjectId\` (newChat, loadProjects, setCurrentProject)
- Timing of these operations can cause unexpected state
- Persisted state survives page refreshes inappropriately
- \`sendMessage\` reads global state instead of receiving explicit parameter

**Proposed Architecture:**
- Remove \`currentProjectId\` from persisted state (or scope persistence to UI preference only)
- \`sendMessage(content, options: { sessionId?, projectId?, model? })\`
- Project context derived from URL (\`/projects/:projectId\`) not global store
- Chat component receives projectId as prop, not from global state

**Benefits:** Eliminates race conditions, clearer data flow, easier to debug

**Complexity:** 3.0/5 (Medium-High - significant refactoring)

#### issue_036: Collapsible Thinking + Tool Call Visibility
**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - UX improvement)
**Component:** \`packages/pwa-app/src/components/ChatMessage.tsx\`
**Created:** 2025-12-03

**Description:** Add collapsible \`<think>...</think>\` blocks and tool call data visibility following Claude Code pattern

**Requirements:**
- Detect and render \`<think>\` blocks as collapsible sections (default: collapsed)
- Show tool calls with input/output data (for debugging)
- Preserve markdown rendering for non-thinking content

**Complexity:** 2.0/5 (Low-Medium - UI enhancement)

---

#### issue_021: Verify Response Styles in Chat
**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - validation)
**Component:** \`packages/pwa-app\`, \`packages/agent-core\`
**Created:** 2025-12-02

**Description:** Verify that Response Styles (Normal, Formal, Concise, Explanatory, Learning) actually affect AI behavior in chat

**Test Plan:**
1. Set style to "Concise" in Settings
2. Start new chat and ask a question
3. Verify response is shorter/more direct than Normal style
4. Repeat for all 5 styles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Style changes persist across page refresh
- [ ] Different styles produce noticeably different responses
- [ ] Current style displays correctly in Tools menu

**Complexity:** 1.0/5 (Low - testing only)

**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P3 (Low - nice to have)

**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P3 (Low - optimization)
**Component:** \`packages/agent-core\`
**Created:** 2025-12-01

**Description:** First request to Ollama model has ~10s delay while model loads. Implement warm-up strategy.

**Options:**
1. Background ping on server start (simple but wastes resources)
2. Warm up on first user login (better UX)
3. LRU cache with auto-unload (complex but optimal)

**Complexity:** 2.5/5 (Medium - depends on approach)

---

#### issue_024: DESIGN.md Visual Reference Workflow
**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P3 (Low - future)
**Component:** Documentation
**Created:** 2025-12-02

**Description:** Establish workflow for visual design references (screenshots, mockups)

**Problem:** DESIGN.md becomes stale as UI evolves
**Proposed:** Move to wiki or use screenshot-based system with version tags

**Complexity:** 1.0/5 (Low - process change)
