## Open Issues

### Priority Decisions

#### issue_008: Memory Architecture Decision
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved (A/B architecture implemented, Option A deployed)
- **Priority**: - (Complete)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server`
- **Research Complete**: 2025-11-30
- **Decision Made**: 2025-11-30
- **Description**: Choose between two memory architectures for Pip
- **Resolution**:
  - **Implemented A/B testing architecture** with `MEMORY_VARIANT` env var
  - **Option A (mem0)**: Deployed to production with Ollama embeddings
  - **Option B (native)**: Available via config switch if needed
  - **Next**: Test both options to determine best approach
- **Technical Details**:
  - `MEMORY_VARIANT=mem0` - Uses mem0ai with Ollama nomic-embed-text
  - `MEMORY_VARIANT=native` - Uses @xenova/transformers for local embeddings
  - Ollama running on VPS as systemd service
  - Memory tools exposed: add_memory, search_memory, list_memories, delete_memory

### Bugs

#### issue_010: Mem0 SQLite CANTOPEN in Docker
- **Status**: 🟡 In Progress (Workaround applied)
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - memory works but without persistence)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server` (memory-mem0.ts)
- **Discovered**: 2025-11-30
- **Description**: Mem0's internal SQLite (for history storage) throws `SQLITE_CANTOPEN: unable to open database file` when running in Docker container, crashing the entire MCP server.
- **Error Details**:
  ```
  [Memory] Mem0 initialized successfully
  <anonymous_script>:0
  [Error: SQLITE_CANTOPEN: unable to open database file
  Emitted 'error' event on Database instance at:
  ] { errno: 14, code: 'SQLITE_CANTOPEN' }
  ```
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - Mem0 uses its own SQLite library (not our better-sqlite3)
  - The `<anonymous_script>:0` suggests lazy/async SQLite initialization
  - Error occurs AFTER "initialized successfully" logs
  - Directory permissions verified OK (container can create files)
  - Pre-creating the .db file didn't help
- **Workaround Applied**:
  - Disabled `historyDbPath` in Mem0 config
  - Memory now works but doesn't persist across container restarts
  - Memories still stored in in-memory vector store during session
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Investigate mem0ai's SQLite library (sql.js? sqlite3?)
  - [ ] Try alternative: use Mem0 Cloud API instead of local storage
  - [ ] Alternative: switch to Option B (native memory with better-sqlite3)
  - [ ] Long-term: open issue on mem0ai GitHub if library bug
- **Notes**: May be related to Docker alpine image or Node.js 20 SQLite bindings.
