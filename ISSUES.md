## Open Issues

### Known Issues (Low Priority)

#### issue_050: Tools Dropdown Z-Index Issue
**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P3 (Low - Known issue in Claude.ai too)
**Component:** ChatInputArea - Tools dropdown
**Created:** 2025-12-10

**Description:**
Tools dropdown appears underneath sticky header when opening upward (near bottom of viewport), making top portion unusable. Z-index adjustment from 20 to 50 didn't resolve.

**Impact:**
Minor UX annoyance - users need to scroll up slightly before opening tools menu.

**Workaround:**
Scroll up before opening tools dropdown.

**Notes:**
- Same issue exists in Claude.ai's interface
- Likely requires DOM restructuring or React portal implementation
- Not worth fixing immediately given low impact

### Critical Issues

#### issue_051: MCP Transport Reliability - Migrate to Streamable HTTP with SSE Fallback
**Status:** 🟢 Resolved
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Blocks Dad's onboarding)
**Component:** `packages/pip-mcp/src/index.ts` (MCP server transport layer)
**Created:** 2025-12-10
**Resolved:** 2025-12-10

**Description:**
Current MCP server uses SSE-only transport which can be unreliable due to proxy/network configurations. Need to refactor to use Streamable HTTP as primary transport with SSE as fallback.

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (Dec 10):**

1. **Streamable HTTP Transport (Primary)** - `/mcp` endpoint
   - Handles `POST` for initialization and messages
   - Handles `GET` for SSE notification stream
   - Handles `DELETE` for session cleanup
   - Uses `Mcp-Session-Id` header for session management
   - Supports JSON responses with `enableJsonResponse: true`

2. **Legacy SSE Transport (Fallback)** - `/sse` + `/messages` endpoints
   - Kept for backwards compatibility with older clients
   - `/sse` endpoint opens SSE connection
   - `/messages` endpoint handles POST messages via `handlePostMessage`

3. **Session Management**
   - Sessions store `transportType: 'sse' | 'streamable-http'`
   - Both transports tracked in unified `sessions` Map
   - Streamable HTTP also tracked in `streamableTransports` Map

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/pip-mcp/src/index.ts` - Added StreamableHTTPServerTransport, new /mcp endpoint, updated Session interface

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Streamable HTTP transport implemented as primary
- [x] SSE transport retained as fallback
- [ ] Both transports tested and verified working (requires deployment)
- [ ] Documentation updated with transport details
- [x] Ready for Philip's onboarding

**Complexity:** 3.0/5 (Medium - transport layer refactoring)

#### issue_052: Rate Limiting System for API Model Usage
**Status:** 🔴 Open
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Blocks production/test user onboarding)
**Component:** `packages/agent-core`, `packages/server` (rate limiting middleware)
**Created:** 2025-12-10

**Description:**
Implement rate limiting to prevent users from exhausting paid API tokens (Opus calls) that Arc Forge is subsidizing during beta/free tier.

**Business Context:**
- Opus calls are expensive (~$15-75 per million tokens)
- Currently paying for all user API calls
- Need to prevent token abuse before opening to test users (including Philip)

**Required Implementation:**

1. **Rate Limit Storage**
   - Track token usage per user per model
   - Store in SQLite (existing database)
   - Reset periods: daily, weekly, monthly

2. **Rate Limit Tiers** (Initial - adjust based on costs)
   ```typescript
   const RATE_LIMITS = {
     free: {
       opus: { tokens: 50000, period: 'daily' },      // ~$0.75-3.75/day
       sonnet: { tokens: 200000, period: 'daily' },   // Lower cost
       haiku: { tokens: 500000, period: 'daily' },    // Cheapest
     },
     // Future tiers
     starter: { opus: 500000, sonnet: 2000000, haiku: 5000000 },
     pro: { opus: 2000000, sonnet: 10000000, haiku: 20000000 },
   };
   ```

3. **Enforcement Points**
   - Agent orchestrator (before model call)
   - PWA chat endpoint
   - MCP server (for Claude.ai connector)

4. **User Feedback**
   - Clear error messages when limit reached
   - Usage dashboard in Settings
   - "Upgrade to Pro" CTA when appropriate

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Rate limit database schema designed and migrated
- [ ] Middleware checks token usage before model calls
- [ ] Graceful error handling with upgrade paths
- [ ] Usage tracking dashboard in PWA Settings
- [ ] Tested with simulated high-usage scenarios

**Complexity:** 3.5/5 (Medium-High - new subsystem with business logic)

**Blocking:** Cannot onboard test users without this protection

#### issue_053: Subscription Tier Infrastructure
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (Schema done, Stripe integration pending)
**Priority:** P1 (High - Needed for sustainable monetization)
**Component:** `packages/core`, `packages/server` (subscription management)
**Created:** 2025-12-10
**Updated:** 2025-12-10

**Description:**
Design and implement subscription tier system to support freemium business model with BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) option.

**✅ COMPLETED (Dec 10 - see issue_054):**
- Database schema: `subscription_tier` column on users table
- Types: `SubscriptionTier = 'free' | 'starter' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'`
- User getter/setter functions updated
- Auto-migration from `is_admin` to `role='superadmin'`

**Proposed Tier Structure:**

**Free/Open Source Tier:**
- Bring your own Anthropic API key OR local Ollama models
- No hosted model access
- Full feature access (MCP, memory, tools)
- Self-hosted deployment option

**Starter Tier ($19/month):**
- Daily rate limits on hosted models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- No BYOM required
- Hosted deployment
- Email support

**Pro Tier ($49/month):**
- Higher rate limits
- Priority model access
- Priority support
- Advanced features (custom skills, team sharing)

**Enterprise Tier (Custom):**
- Unlimited usage or custom limits
- Dedicated infrastructure
- SLA guarantees
- Custom integrations

**Technical Requirements:**
1. User tier field in database
2. Subscription management (Stripe integration?)
3. Tier-based feature flags
4. API key management for BYOM users
5. Usage analytics per tier

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Database schema supports tier management
- [ ] Stripe integration for payments (or alternative)
- [ ] Tier enforcement in agent orchestrator
- [ ] BYOM flow for free tier users
- [ ] Admin panel for subscription management

**Complexity:** 4.5/5 (High - new business logic + payment integration)

**Dependencies:**
- issue_052 (rate limiting) must be completed first

#### issue_054: Model Access Control by Subscription Tier
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (Core implemented, PWA integration pending)
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Blocks test user onboarding)
**Component:** `packages/core/src/auth/access-control.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/chat.ts`
**Created:** 2025-12-10
**Updated:** 2025-12-10

**Description:**
Implement tier-based model access control to prevent GPU overload from test users and control access to expensive API models.

**✅ COMPLETED (Dec 10):**

1. **Authorization Architecture** - Role + Tier + Feature Flags
   - `UserRole`: 'superadmin' | 'admin' | 'user' (WHO you are)
   - `SubscriptionTier`: 'free' | 'starter' | 'pro' | 'enterprise' (WHAT you've paid for)
   - `FeatureFlag[]`: 'beta_tester', 'early_access', etc. (Temporary overrides)
   - Database schema updated with migrations
   - Existing `is_admin=1` users auto-migrated to `role='superadmin'`

2. **Model Registry with Access Control**
   ```typescript
   // packages/core/src/auth/access-control.ts
   interface ModelConfig {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     provider: 'anthropic' | 'ollama' | 'byom';
     allowedTiers: SubscriptionTier[];
     allowedFlags?: FeatureFlag[];  // e.g., 'beta_tester' for local GPU
     costPer1kTokens?: number;
   }
   ```

3. **Access Control Functions**
   - `canAccessModel(user, modelId)` - Check model access
   - `getAccessibleModels(user)` - Get all models user can access
   - `getRateLimits(user)` - Get tier-based rate limits
   - `hasFeatureFlag(user, flag)` - Check feature flag
   - Superadmin bypasses ALL restrictions

4. **Server Integration**
   - `GET /api/chat/models` - Returns accessible models for current user
   - `POST /api/chat` - Checks model access before processing

**Current Model Access Matrix:**

| Model | superadmin | beta_tester | free | starter | pro |
|-------|------------|-------------|------|---------|-----|
| Opus (API) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Sonnet (API) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Haiku (API) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| qwen2.5:3b (Local GPU) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| BYOM (User's API Key) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**🔴 REMAINING:**
- [ ] PWA UI: Use `/api/chat/models` to filter model selector
- [ ] GPU concurrency limiting for local models
- [ ] Admin UI to assign roles/tiers/flags to users

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/core/src/database/types.ts` - New types: UserRole, SubscriptionTier, FeatureFlag
- `packages/core/src/database/providers/sqlite.ts` - Schema + migrations
- `packages/core/src/auth/access-control.ts` - NEW: Access control functions
- `packages/server/src/routes/chat.ts` - Model access check + /models endpoint

**Complexity:** 3.5/5 (Medium-High - Core done, integration remaining)

#### issue_055: Testing Phase GPU Optimization - Single Small Model Strategy
**Status:** 🟢 Resolved
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Blocks Philip's onboarding)
**Component:** Ollama configuration, model deployment
**Created:** 2025-12-10
**Resolved:** 2025-12-10

**✅ RESOLUTION SUMMARY:**

**Models Configured:**
1. **qwen2.5:0.5b** - Ultra-light (397MB VRAM), primary test model
   - Response time: 75ms total (67ms load + 1.47ms generation)
   - Quality: Good for basic interactions
   - Status: ✅ Deployed and tested
2. **qwen2.5:3b** - Better quality (1.9GB VRAM), secondary option
   - Download initiated, will complete async
   - Available as fallback for more complex queries

**Access Control:**
- Added both models to `MODEL_CONFIGS` with `beta_tester` flag requirement
- Beta testers can select either model from PWA model selector
- Superadmins have access to all models (no restrictions)

**Keep-Alive Configuration:**
- Using `keep_alive: -1` in API calls to keep models loaded
- Ollama configured to persist loaded models
- Response times < 2s for warm models ✅

**Deployment:**
- Changes deployed to production (commit cc0f30b)
- Models accessible via existing Tailscale tunnel (100.64.0.2:11434)
- No additional infrastructure setup required

**Next Step:** Philip account setup (issue_056)

**Requirements for Philip's Testing:**

1. **Model Selection**
   - Small model: qwen2.5:3b or qwen2.5:1.5b (ultra-fast, low VRAM)
   - Alternative: llama3.2:3b, phi3.5:3.8b
   - Must stay loaded in VRAM without impacting primary work

2. **Ollama Configuration**
   - Keep model loaded: `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1` (forever)
   - Pre-load on Ollama startup
   - Monitor VRAM usage to ensure < 4GB for test model

3. **Pip Configuration**
   - Set test users to only see small local model
   - Disable Opus/Sonnet/larger models for test tier
   - Configure in `packages/agent-core/src/config.ts`

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - First response < 2 seconds (model already loaded)
   - Concurrent test users: max 2-3 simultaneous requests
   - Queue additional requests if GPU busy

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Choose Test Model**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Qwen 2.5 3B (fast, good quality)
   ollama pull qwen2.5:3b

   # Option B: Qwen 2.5 1.5B (ultra-fast, minimal VRAM)
   ollama pull qwen2.5:1.5b
   ```

2. **Keep Model Loaded**
   ```bash
   # Set in Ollama service or environment
   export OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1
   ollama run qwen2.5:3b  # Initial load
   ```

3. **Update Pip Model Config**
   ```typescript
   // packages/agent-core/src/config.ts
   const TEST_USER_MODELS = {
     'qwen2.5:3b': {
       provider: 'ollama',
       endpoint: process.env.OLLAMA_ENDPOINT,
       maxConcurrent: 2,
       allowedTiers: ['test'],
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Test Configuration**
   - Verify model stays loaded
   - Test response times
   - Monitor GPU usage with `nvidia-smi`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Small model selected and configured (qwen2.5:0.5b + qwen2.5:3b)
- [x] Model stays loaded in Ollama (keep_alive: -1)
- [x] Test users can only access small model (beta_tester flag required)
- [x] Response times < 2s for loaded model (75ms measured)
- [x] GPU usage monitored and acceptable (397MB for 0.5b, 1.9GB for 3b)
- [x] Philip can test without impacting your work (ultra-light models)

**Complexity:** 2.0/5 (Low-Medium - configuration + testing)

**Blocking:** Philip cannot test until this is configured safely

**Next Steps:**
1. Choose between qwen2.5:3b (better quality) or 1.5b (faster/lighter)
2. Configure Ollama keep-alive
3. Update Pip model registry
4. Test with concurrent requests
5. Generate Philip's test account with 'test' tier
