## Risk Registry

Risks identified during blueprint complexity assessment.

### risk_000: Xero 25-User Limit for Unapproved Apps
- **Severity**: High
- **Probability**: Certain (hard limit)
- **Impact**: Cannot onboard more than 25 users until Xero app approval
- **Constraint**: Xero requires app approval for >25 connected organizations
- **Mitigation**:
  - Track connected Xero orgs in database
  - Enforce limit in code (reject new Xero connections after 25)
  - Apply for Xero app approval before hitting limit
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Add user count check before Xero OAuth
  - [ ] Display "beta full" message when limit reached
  - [ ] Track connected org count in admin dashboard
- **Timeline**: Must implement before public beta launch
- **Reference**: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/app-partnership/

### risk_001: VPS Memory Constraint
- **Severity**: High
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Cannot self-host Chatterbox TTS
- **Mitigation**: spike_003 (Chatterbox Feasibility Spike)
- **Contingency**: Use cloud TTS API (ElevenLabs $0.18/1000 chars)

### risk_002: Demo Incomplete
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Thursday demo fails to show Business Context Layer
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize features 1.1, 1.3, task 1.4.2 (demo critical path)
- **Contingency**: Demo existing Xero features + explain context vision

### risk_003: Voice Latency Too High
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Voice conversations feel sluggish (>2s latency)
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing at each pipeline stage
- **Contingency**: Accept higher latency for MVP; optimize post-launch

## Using PROGRESS.md + ISSUES.md vs GitHub Issues

This project uses a **streamlined markdown-based tracking approach** instead of GitHub Issues.

### When to Use This Approach
- Solo developer or small team (1-3 people)
- Fast iteration cycles
- Don't need external stakeholder visibility
- Want to keep all project context in repository
- AI-assisted development (context stays in codebase)

### When to Use GitHub Issues Instead
- Team > 3 people needing assignment/ownership
- External stakeholders need visibility
- Need automated workflows (GitHub Actions triggered by issues)
- Complex dependency tracking with sub-issues
- Roadmap views and project boards

### Relationship to Blueprint
- **BLUEPRINT.yaml**: Architectural plan with complexity scores
- **PROGRESS.md**: Execution tracking (task status, completion)
- **ISSUES.md**: Problems, improvements, flagged items, risks
- **STATUS.md**: 2-week rolling snapshot for quick reference
