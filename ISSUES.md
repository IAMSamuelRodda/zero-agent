## Open Issues

### Priority Decisions

#### issue_008: Memory Architecture Decision
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved (Option B deployed - native memory)
- **Priority**: - (Complete)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server`
- **Resolved**: 2025-11-30
- **Description**: Choose between two memory architectures for Pip
- **Resolution**:
  - **Option A (mem0)**: REJECTED - SQLite crashes in Docker/Alpine
  - **Option B (native)**: SELECTED - Text-based search, works in Alpine
  - Memory tools verified working on both Claude.ai and ChatGPT
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses `memory-native.ts` with better-sqlite3
  - Text-based search (semantic search deferred)
  - 5 tools: add_memory, search_memory, list_memories, delete_memory, delete_all_memories

---

### Bugs

#### issue_010: Mem0 SQLite CANTOPEN in Docker (RESOLVED)
- **Status**: 🟢 Resolved (Switched to Option B native memory)
- **Priority**: - (Complete)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server` (memory-native.ts)
- **Discovered**: 2025-11-30
- **Resolved**: 2025-11-30
- **Description**: Mem0's internal SQLite throws `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` regardless of configuration, crashing the MCP server.
- **Root Cause**: mem0ai library has internal SQLite that fails in Docker/Alpine
- **Additional Issue**: @xenova/transformers requires glibc (onnxruntime), but Alpine uses musl
- **Resolution**:
  - Switched to Option B (native memory implementation)
  - Removed @xenova/transformers import (crashes Alpine at import time)
  - Implemented text-based search instead of semantic/embedding search
  - Memory tools now functional with better-sqlite3
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Text search instead of semantic search (less intelligent matching)
  - Embeddings available if we switch to Debian-based Docker image
- **Commits**:
  - `d508336` - Initial Option B implementation with table creation
  - `3c839bd` - Remove @xenova/transformers import to fix Alpine crash
- **Notes**: Report to https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/issues when time permits.

- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server`, `packages/pwa-app`
- **Description**: Add "Manage memory" UI and track user explicit edit requests separately from auto-extracted memory.
- **Resolution**: Merged into Epic 2.1 (feature_2_1_2 through feature_2_1_5) on 2025-12-01
- **See**: PROGRESS.md → Epic 2.1 for detailed tasks
- **UX Reference**: `specs/spike-outputs/UX-PATTERNS-CLAUDE-AI-REFERENCE-20251201.md` Pattern 0.7

#### issue_017: Ollama Model Warm-Up Strategy
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - UX improvement)
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app`, LiteLLM proxy
- **Description**: Ollama models have ~14s cold start (loading into GPU). Need to investigate pre-warming strategies.
- **Context**:
  - Cold start: ~14s (model loading into VRAM)
  - Warm latency: ~238ms (excellent)
- **Investigation Areas**:
  - [ ] Trigger model warm-up when user selects Ollama model in dropdown
  - [ ] Background warm-up while user is typing (if message is long)
  - [ ] Keep model loaded with periodic ping (prevent unload)
  - [ ] Display "warming up..." indicator in UI
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Measure actual cold/warm latency with integrated PWA
  - [ ] Determine if 14s cold start is acceptable or needs mitigation
  - [ ] If needed, implement pre-warming strategy
- **Notes**: Defer implementation until Ollama is integrated into PWA. Test real-world UX first.

#### issue_016: Light/Dark Mode Theme Support
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P3 (Low - future enhancement)
- **Component**: All frontend packages (`packages/pwa-app`, `packages/mcp-remote-server`, `landing-page.html`)
- **Description**: Add light/dark mode toggle with CSS variables for easy theme switching
- **Current State**: All pages use hardcoded dark theme colors
- **Target State**: CSS variables with theme toggle, respects system preference
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Extract colors to CSS variables (already partially done in landing page)
  - [ ] Add theme toggle in settings
  - [ ] Persist theme preference in localStorage
  - [ ] Respect `prefers-color-scheme` media query
  - [ ] Consistent theming across all pages (PWA, MCP login, landing)
- **Notes**: Low priority - current dark theme is consistent with brand. Implement when user feedback requests it.

#### issue_022: Enhanced "Thinking" Indicator (Claude Code Pattern)
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - UX engagement)
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app`, `packages/server`
- **Description**: Current "Checking your data... (Xs)" is too generic. Users want visibility into what Pip is actually doing.
- **Reference**: Claude Code shows dynamic status updates:
  - Tool being called: "Bash(git status && git diff)"
  - Action description: "Updating STATUS.md..."
  - Thinking indicator: "Thinking..." with duration
  - Progress steps: Shows sequence of operations
- **Current State**:
  - Static "Checking your data..." message
  - Only shows elapsed time
  - No visibility into tools being called
- **Target State**:
  - Show tool name when Xero API is called (e.g., "Fetching invoices...")
  - Show operation context (e.g., "Analyzing P&L report...")
  - Stream status updates from backend
  - Consider: SSE for real-time status updates
- **Implementation Options**:
  - Option A: Server-sent events (SSE) for streaming status
  - Option B: Polling endpoint for status updates
  - Option C: WebSocket connection for bidirectional updates
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Design status message schema (tool, action, duration)
  - [ ] Backend emits status events during processing
  - [ ] Frontend displays dynamic status messages
  - [ ] Shows specific tool/operation being performed
  - [ ] Elapsed time per operation (not just total)
- **Complexity**: 2.5-3.0/5 (Medium - requires streaming infrastructure)
- **Notes**: Makes the tool feel more responsive and trustworthy. Users see Pip is "working" not "stuck".

#### issue_025: Header Cleanup + Claude.ai Layout Pattern
- **Status**: 🟢 Resolved
- **Priority**: - (Complete)
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app`
- **Created**: 2025-12-02

- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - UX polish)
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app` (ChatSidebar.tsx)
- **Created**: 2025-12-02
- **Description**: Several UX issues with collapsed sidebar state
- **Problems Identified**:
  1. **Chat list stacking**: Chats will stack up fast - need collapsible section toggle
  2. **Collapsed icons**: Currently shows multiple chat icons when collapsed - should be single icon that expands sidebar
  3. **Docs icon position**: Should be near top of sidebar (after New chat), not at bottom
- **Target Pattern** (Claude.ai collapsed sidebar):
  - Toggle icon (expand/collapse)
  - New chat button (always visible)
  - Single chat icon (expands sidebar to show list)
  - Docs/files icon near top
  - Profile at bottom
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Add collapsible "Chats" section with toggle

#### issue_029: MCP Auth Flow - Database Reference Issue
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - potential bug)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server`
- **Created**: 2025-12-02
- **Description**: MCP auth flow may be referencing old/stale database. User with Protonmail login wasn't recognized.
- **Investigation**:
  - [ ] Check OAuth token storage in pip.db vs old zero-agent.db
  - [ ] Verify database migration was complete
  - [ ] Check if MCP server is using correct database path
  - [ ] Test fresh login flow
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Database path mismatch after naming migration
  - User record created in old database
  - OAuth tokens not migrated
- **Notes**: User reported Protonmail login not recognized during MCP connector auth

#### issue_023: Edge Cases - Empty Chat + Memory Retrieval
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P1 (High - core functionality bugs)
- **Component**: `packages/server`, `packages/agent-core`
- **Discovered**: 2025-12-02
- **Description**: Multiple edge cases discovered during testing that need investigation.
- **Symptoms**:
  1. **Empty chat delete fails**: Created a chat, didn't use it. Tried to delete → got error. After adding a message, delete worked.
  2. **Memory not retrieved**: User has existing memory entry ("likes mushrooms") but Pip says "This is our first conversation". Memory lookup may be failing silently.
  3. **New chat inherits nothing**: Starting a fresh chat in same session doesn't carry over user memory context.
- **Investigation Areas**:
  - [ ] Check delete endpoint - does it require messages to exist?
  - [ ] Check memory retrieval in agent orchestrator - is it called on every chat?
  - [ ] Check if memory is scoped per-session vs per-user
  - [ ] Add logging to memory retrieval path
  - [ ] Test: Create user memory → new chat → ask "what do you know about me?"
- **Suspected Root Causes**:
  - Delete: May be checking for session existence incorrectly
  - Memory: Memory service may not be injected into chat context, OR memory search is returning empty
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Empty chats can be deleted without error
  - [ ] Memory is retrieved and injected into every new chat
  - [ ] User can ask "what do you remember about me?" and get accurate response
- **Related**: Epic 2.1 (Memory Architecture), Epic 2.2 (Chat History)

#### issue_024: DESIGN.md Enhancement - Visual Reference Workflow
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P3 (Low - future enhancement for new projects)
- **Component**: `docs/UI-UX-DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`
- **Created**: 2025-12-02
- **Description**: Implement visual reference-based design direction workflow for future frontend projects.
- **Context**:
  - `blueprint-workflow-orchestrator` v2.2.0 added Step 1b: Design Direction
  - Playwright MCP added to lazy-mcp for visual exploration
  - Visual references > text descriptions for establishing design language
- **Workflow** (from orchestrator):
  1. Ask user for 2-3 design examples (URLs or screenshots)
  2. Use Playwright (CLI preferred, MCP fallback) to explore websites
  3. Extract visual patterns: typography, colors, layout, components
  4. Pass `design_references` to DESIGN.md population step
  5. Validate against `improving-visuals` anti-slop checklist
- **For Pip PWA**:
  - [ ] Create `DESIGN.md` document capturing current design system
  - [ ] Document arc-* color palette and token mapping
  - [ ] Extract typography choices (JetBrains Mono, etc.)
  - [ ] Document component patterns (buttons, forms, cards)
  - [ ] Add anti-slop checklist validation
- **Tools Available**:
  - Playwright CLI: `playwright screenshot <url> screenshot.png --full-page`
  - Playwright MCP: `browser_navigate`, `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_snapshot`
- **Related Skills**:
  - `frontend-aesthetics` (proactive anti-slop guidance)
  - `improving-visuals` (8-dimension rubric assessment)
- **Notes**: Apply to Pip when doing major UI work. For now, current design works well.

#### issue_021: Verify Response Styles in Chat
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - feature validation)
- **Component**: `packages/agent-core`, `packages/pwa-app`
- **Description**: Test that Response Styles actually modify Pip's chat responses as intended.
- **Test Plan**:
  - [ ] Set style to "Formal" → Ask a question → Verify professional tone, no contractions
  - [ ] Set style to "Concise" → Ask same question → Verify shorter, bullet-point response
  - [ ] Set style to "Explanatory" → Ask same question → Verify detailed reasoning
  - [ ] Set style to "Learning" → Ask same question → Verify educational tone, defines terms
  - [ ] Set style back to "Normal" → Verify default balanced response
- **Notes**: UI dropdown deployed and working (verified 2025-12-02). Need manual testing of actual response behavior.

#### issue_019: Safety Settings UI - Explanation Box Placement
- **Status**: 🔴 Open
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - UX clarity)
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app` (Settings page)
- **Description**: The "Why Safety Settings?" explanation box is visually disconnected from the safety settings it explains, and its styling makes it look like an interactive element (button/card).
- **Current State**:
  - Explanation box appears after Personality and Memory sections
  - Uses card-like styling that suggests clickability
  - Visually separated from the Safety Settings it references
- **Target State**:
  - Explanation should be visually paired with Safety Settings (adjacent or inline)
  - Should NOT look interactive - use muted/helper text styling
  - Consider: inline helper text, collapsible details, or subtle info block
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Move explanation closer to Safety Settings section
  - [ ] Remove button/card-like appearance
  - [ ] Use helper text styling (smaller, muted color)
  - [ ] Ensure it doesn't look clickable

- **Resolution**: Core projects feature complete. Multi-Xero org and cross-project reference deferred to future work.
- **Commits**: `609c952` - Initial implementation (schema, API, UI)

#### issue_014: Per-Chat Document Upload (Epic 2.4)
- **Status**: 🔴 Open (spike complete - ready to implement)
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium - UX improvement)

- **Blueprint**: feature_2_4_1 through feature_2_4_3
- **Description**: Plus (+) icon in chat for attachments (standard UX pattern). Document preview below chat input field.
- **Spike**: spike_m2_002 ✅ COMPLETE - Decision: Keep React, use react-dropzone
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Complete React refactor assessment spike first
  - [ ] Design session_documents schema and storage strategy
  - [ ] File upload API with validation and size limits
  - [ ] Plus (+) icon attachment button with drag-and-drop (use react-dropzone)

#### issue_015: Pip's Voice/Personality (Epic 2.5)
- **Status**: 🔵 Deferred (replaced by issue_020)
- **Priority**: P3 (Future - not MVP critical)
- **Component**: `packages/mcp-remote-server` (system prompts), `packages/core/src/personalities/`
- **Blueprint**: feature_2_5_1 through feature_2_5_5
- **Description**: Switchable character personalities that can change mid-chat without losing context.
- **Spike Complete** (spike_m2_003): ✅
  - Literary analysis, Grok modes research, personality schema defined
  - Adelaide and Pippin profiles created in `packages/core/src/personalities/`
  - `buildPersonalityPrompt()` function implemented
- **Option A - Adelaide Bookkeeper**: Professional, approachable, no jargon
- **Option B - Pippin (LOTR-inspired)**: Playful, warm, surprisingly competent
- **Deferred Reason** (2025-12-02):
  - "Personality" terminology is assumptive - implies the tool has its own character
  - Could scare off business users who want a reliable assistant, not an employee to understand
  - Better approach: Start with neutral "Styles" (issue_020), personality can layer on top later
- **Preserved Assets**:
  - `packages/core/src/personalities/adelaide.ts` - Profile for future use
  - `packages/core/src/personalities/pippin.ts` - Profile for future use
  - `buildPersonalityPrompt()` infrastructure ready
- **Notes**: Not deleted - deferred to post-Styles implementation. Could become premium feature.

#### issue_020: Response Styles (Claude.ai Pattern)
- **Status**: 🟢 Complete
- **Priority**: - (Deployed)
- **Resolved**: 2025-12-02
- **Component**: `packages/pwa-app`, `packages/server`, `packages/core`, `packages/agent-core`
- **Description**: Implement response style selector modeled after Claude.ai's style system (Formal, Explanatory, Concise, Learning, Normal).
- **Rationale**:
  - "Styles" puts control in user's hands (vs "Personality" which implies AI character)
  - More neutral/professional for business tool
  - Could integrate with memory in future (remember style preferences)
  - Direct user request - standard UX pattern from Claude.ai
- **Reference**: Claude.ai Settings → Response Styles dropdown
- **Styles Implemented**:
  - **Normal** (default): Balanced, natural responses
  - **Formal**: Professional tone, complete sentences
  - **Concise**: Brief, to-the-point answers
  - **Explanatory**: Detailed with context and reasoning
  - **Learning**: Educational, explains concepts
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Add `response_style` column to user_settings table
  - [x] Create style definitions (system prompt modifiers)
  - [x] Style selector in Settings page (dropdown matching Claude.ai UI)
  - [x] Apply style to system prompt in agent orchestrator
  - [x] Persist style preference per user
  - [ ] Optional: Quick style toggle in chat header (deferred)
- **Complexity**: 2.0/5 (Low-Medium - simpler than full personality system)
- **Implementation**:
  - `packages/core/src/styles/index.ts` - Style definitions with prompt modifiers
  - `packages/core/src/database/types.ts` - ResponseStyleId type
  - `packages/core/src/database/providers/sqlite.ts` - Migration + CRUD
  - `packages/server/src/routes/settings.ts` - GET /api/settings/styles endpoint
  - `packages/pwa-app/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Dropdown selector
  - `packages/agent-core/src/orchestrator.ts` - Style injection into system prompt
- **Commit**: `e897c44`
