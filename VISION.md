# Agent Zero (Pip) - Vision

**Your AI bookkeeping assistant.**

Ask questions about your business finances and get plain-English answers instantly. Stop digging through accounting software—just ask.

*Currently supports Xero. MYOB and QuickBooks planned (modular MCP architecture).*

> **Rebrand note**: "Zero" sounds like "Xero" when spoken—brand collision risk. Keep name through validation, rebrand after.
>
> **Leading candidate**: "Pip" / "Ask Pip" - friendly helper positioning, 1 syllable, works as verb ("Ask Pip about my GST"). Domain `askpip.au` secured (Black Friday 2024). See Joplin: "Rebranding Research: Naming Trends & Directions" for full analysis. 

## Philosophy

We believe AI assistants should:
- ✅ **Respect user freedom** - Own your data, choose your AI provider
- ✅ **Enable privacy** - Self-host on your infrastructure if you want
- ✅ **Avoid vendor lock-in** - Use Anthropic, OpenAI, local models, or any future LLM
- ✅ **Charge for value** - Pay for convenience and infrastructure, not for code

We don't believe in:
- ❌ **Extracting rent** - No forced subscriptions for basic features
- ❌ **Data silos** - Your financial data should stay where you want it
- ❌ **Artificial limitations** - If you run it yourself, use it however you want
- ❌ **Black box software** - All code is open, auditable, and forkable

## What We Build

**Open Source Platform**:
- Full codebase released under MIT license
- Self-hostable with Docker or your own cloud
- Works with ANY LLM backend (API keys, or local models)
- Database agnostic (SQLite, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Supabase)

**Managed Service** (Optional):
- We run the infrastructure so you don't have to
- One bill, zero DevOps, automatic updates
- Pay for convenience, not code access

**Xero Integration Expertise**:
- Deep integration with Xero API (invoices, expenses, bank rec, reporting)
- Agent workflows optimized for bookkeeping tasks
- MCP server for extensibility

## Business Model

**Free** (Self-Hosted):
- All features, unlimited usage
- You run infrastructure, bring your own LLM
- Community support via GitHub

**Managed Hosting**:
- We run everything (hosting, database, updates)
- Priority email support

**Enterprise**:
- Managed infrastructure + managed AI included
- Custom integrations available

**Revenue Philosophy**:
- Charge for what costs us to run (AWS, support time)
- Don't charge for code (it's open source)


## Why Open Source?

**For Users**:
- Trust through transparency (audit the code)
- Privacy for sensitive financial data (self-host)
- No vendor lock-in (fork and modify freely)
- Future-proof (community maintains even if we don't)

**For Us**:
- Community contributions improve the product
- Brand reputation attracts managed hosting customers
- Compete on quality and service, not artificial scarcity

## Differentiation

**Others**: "Pay us to use our app and loose everything if you stop paying us."
**Us**: "Here's the code. Use it however you want. We'll run it for you if convenient. If you stop, you can set up your own."

Our competitive advantages:
1. **Xero integration depth** (hard to replicate)
2. **LLM flexibility** (no vendor lock-in)
3. **Community trust** (open source = transparent)
4. **Deployment choice** (self-host OR managed)


## License

MIT - Maximum freedom to use, modify, and distribute.
